# Game-Engines-1-Assignment-Procedural-Audio-Visuals
This is an assignment for Game Engines 1 (Final year) Dublin Institute of Technology

# Project Overview/Proposal :
The requirnments for this project are to create a procedural generation system in Unity3D.
My plan is to create 3D visuals that respond to a sound source. The sound source will be analysed with code and the environment will procedurally build and respond based on the sound source that is playing in realtime. I plan to create beautiful visuals that engage the visual senses and enchance the listening experience, and somewhat represent the music visually.
