# Game-Engines-1-Assignment-Procedural-Audio-Visuals
This is an assignment for Game Engines 1 (Final year) Dublin Institute of Technology

# Project Overview/Proposal :
The requirnments for this project are to create a procedural generation system in Unity3D.
My plan is to create 3D visuals that respond to a sound source. The sound source will be analysed with code and the environment will procedurally build and respond based on the sound source that is playing in realtime. I plan to create beautiful visuals that engage the visual senses and enchance the listening experience, and somewhat represent the music visually.

Some inspiration for what I am going for are posted bellow. I would like to generate a mesh terrain that reacts to the  different frequency ranges from the sound source (split the sound into bands). Also would like to have some sort of procedural mesh generation based off the sound source and values derived. This will create beautiful objects and formation of meshes (potenitally some creatures that dancce to the music (Procedurall animations)). Color changing and texture modification based on the music. 

Best case scenario the application will work on any sound source provided and will work and create beautiful music to any music genre. Slower beat per minute music and higher beat per minute music will be represented respectevly.

# Research Plan & Implementation plan
- Interpreting sound from a sound source in Unity
- Applying sound interpretation to objects and meshes in Unity
- Mesh building (Research how to manually build meshes in Unity)
- Mesh deformation in Unity
- Mathematical algorithms to create beatiful structures
- Procedural animations
- Post processing
